          <h1>Who we are</h1>
          <p>
            Pet Heaven Society is a dedicated non-profit organization focused on rescuing, rehabilitating, 
            and finding forever homes for abandoned pets, with a special focus on cats and dogs. We believe 
            that every animal deserves a second chance, 
            and our mission is to give them the opportunity to find a loving and caring home.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a community of animal lovers, volunteers, 
            and supporters who are passionate about the welfare of animals. 
            Our work goes beyond just providing shelter â€” we aim to educate the public, 
            advocate for animal rights, and promote responsible pet ownership.
          </p>
          <h1>Our mission</h1>
          <p>Our mission is simple: to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome pets in 
            need while advocating for the humane treatment of all animals. We strive to make 
            a difference in the lives of animals by providing them with medical care, training, 
            and a safe environment until they find their forever families.
            We believe that a healthy and happy pet is a lifelong companion, and our goal is to 
            make that possible for as many animals as we can. Whether it's rescuing a stray from the 
            streets or helping a pet owner in need, our commitment to animal welfare drives everything we do.
          </p>
          <h1>Our Values</h1>
          <p>
            Compassion: Treating every animal with kindness and respect.
            Transparency: Being open and honest with our supporters, adopters, and volunteers.
            Community: Working together with volunteers, donors, and adopters to create a strong support network for animals.
            Advocacy: Speaking up for the rights of animals and ensuring they receive the care they deserve.
            Responsibility: Promoting responsible pet ownership and the importance of lifelong commitment to animals.
